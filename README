GTimer v2.0.0
Copyright (C) 1998-2010 Craig Knudsen, craig@k5n.us

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTK 2.8 or later

It should build without issue on any UN*X that has GTK.  It should also
build on Windows machines that have the Windows port of GTK.  Recent versions
of Cygwin include GTK for Windows.  I have also compiled it on Mac OS X and
it works great, but you may need to install X11 (from Apple) depending on
which version of OS X you have, and you will need to install GTK for Mac OS X.

COMPILING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the following sequence of commands to build:

./configure
make

If you are monkeying around with the source and automake stuff, you may
use the following commands to update the configure script.  (This is
not needed for the vast majority of source code changes.)

aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf

For more source code build documentation, see the INSTALL file.


RUNNING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run:
	./gtimer


LICENSE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTimer is open source released under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
Version 2.  See the COPYING file for a complete copy of the license.


NEW RELEASES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To check for new releases, try the "Tools->Check for New Version" item
in the menu.

USING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command line options:
-midnight N	If you work past midnight, then use this to keep hours up
		until N count toward the previous day.
		Example:
		  -midnight 400
		  All hours up until 4AM will be applied to previous day.
-nosplash	Do not show the splash screen on app startup.
-start taskname	Start timing the specified task
-resume		Start timing the same tasks that were on when the application
		last exited.
-version	Display the gtimer version
-help		Get help on usage


TO DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Catch some signals (SIGINT, for example) so we can save date before
  exiting.  GIMP does this, so it should be possible.
- Show the GNU license on initial run of the app.
- Online help.
- Postscript output for printing rather than plain text.
- Make a smaller main window (like gtcd)
- Optionally store data in MySQL, Oracle, etc. instead of flat files
- Add a configuration window to set things like print command,
  idle timeout, etc.
- Export function (CSV file)
- Ability to edit existing annotations
